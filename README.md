# capdiss - CAPture file DISSector

## [Homepage](https://codeward.org/software/capdiss)

_Capdiss_ is a runtime environment for reading capture files (_pcap_, _pcap-ng_).
It defines a simple event-driven API for _Lua_ scripts. The aim of capdiss is to
provide a comfortable environment for packet manipulation, where an analyst
has to write less code, to do more, in a type-safe language. To achieve that,
_capdiss_ embeds powerful, yet minimalistic, scripting language _Lua_, and supports
the native packet dissection framework [Coroner](https://codeward.org/software/coroner).
