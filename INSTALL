capdiss - a runtime environment for reading capture files (pcap, pcap-ng).

1. Dependencies

- Lua >= 5.2

- libpcap >= 1.0

2. Compilation

On Linux run `make` to start a compilation, if all dependencies are met, a
compiled binary file 'capdiss' will be placed inside src/ directory. Calling
`make` will produce a dynamically linked binary.

Optionally you can set following Makefile variables:

- STRIPPED=1 produces a stripped binary.

- USE_LUA=<LUA_VERSION> link against Lua library version LUA_VERSION (i.e.
  5.3), by default Lua version 5.2 is assumed.

- INSTALL_PATH=/new/install/path override default installation path (/usr/local/bin).

Example: `make STRIPPED=1 USE_LUA=5.3`

On Windows, run `mingw32-make -f Makefile.win CC=mingw32-gcc` to start a compilation.

3. Installation

Run `make install`. This will install the compiled binary file into
/usr/local/bin, unless this option is overriden.

On Windows, installation rule is not available. User must place the compiled
binary in a directory of his choosing, preferably in one that is being
referenced in system variable %PATH%.
