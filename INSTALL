capdiss - Capture file dissector with embedded Lua interpreter.

1. Dependencies

- Lua version 5.2 or latter (if building a dynamically linked binary)

- libpcap version 1.0 or latter / winpcap version ??

2. Compilation

On Linux run `make` to start a compilation, if all dependencies are met, a
compiled binary file 'capdiss' will be placed inside src/ directory. Calling
`make` will produce a dynamically linked binary, if you wish to link to Lua
statically, run `make LUA_STATIC=1`. Please note that, variable LUA_STATIC has
only influence over the linking with Lua.

On Windows run `make -f Makefile.win CC=mingw32-gcc` to start a compilation.
When compiling for Windows, Lua is always compiled statically.

3. Installation

Run `make install`. This will install the compiled binary file into
/usr/local/bin, unless this option is overriden. To override the default
install directory, use `make install INSTALL_PATH=/your/new/path`.

On Windows, installation rule is not available. User must place the compiled
binary in a directory of his choosing, preferably in one that is being
referenced by the Path system variable.
