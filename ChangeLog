version 0.2.0
-------------

* New option -t that allows to specify a packet filter program to filter out

overflows and segmentation faults.

* FIX: execution of Capdiss methods should be skipped or canceled if a
termination signal was caught prior or during their execution.

version 0.1.0
-------------
