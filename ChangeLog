-------------

* Capdiss table identificator is now lower-case ('Capdiss' => 'capdiss').

* Pass filename and link-type as parameters to the method 'capdiss.begin'.

parameter, followed by a frame timestamp and at last a frame number.

* Frame timestamp is now in microseconds.

* Change command line argument '-e, --source' => '-s, --run-source'.

* Change command line argument '-f, --file' => '-r, --run'.

* Change command line argument '-t, --filter' => '-F, --filter'.

* Add support for new function 'sigaction' which, if defined, is triggered
after a signal is delivered to capdiss. The function takes one parameter, the
signal number.
